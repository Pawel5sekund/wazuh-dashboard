# This workflow automates backporting of _pull requests_ (PR) to other
# branches when:
#
# 1. A PR is closed and has been merged (`closed` + `merged`).
# 2. The `backport` label is added to a PR.
#
# ### ðŸ”§ What does the workflow do?
# - Generates an automatic backport of the closed or labeled PR.
# - Skips the `CHANGELOG.md` file when backporting.
# - Adds the `autocut` label to the backport PR.
# - Adds the `failed backport` label if the process fails.
#
# ### âœ¨ What is it for?
# This workflow is useful for keeping multiple branches synchronized with
# relevant changes without manual intervention.
