# This workflow automatically deletes the branch of a backport PR after it has
# been merged.
#
# ### ðŸ”§ What does the workflow do?
# - Triggering event: It runs when a pull request is closed (`pull_request:
#   closed`).
#
# - Condition (`if`): It only acts if the branch of the closed PR starts with
#   `backport/`.
#
# ### âœ¨ What is it for?
# This workflow helps keep the repository clean by automatically deleting
# backport branches after they have already been merged and are no longer
# needed.
